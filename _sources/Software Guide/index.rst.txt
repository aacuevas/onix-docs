Currently, the ONIX project is targeting `Bonsai <https://bonsai-rx.org/>`__
for its software needs. Bonsai is extremely good at dealing with the
asynchronous and heterogeneous data that ONIX hardware produces. Have a look at
the :ref:`bonsai_onixref` for detailed information on each of the elements of
``Bonsai.ONIX`` library. See :ref:`bonsai_examples` for example
workflows that work out of the box with ONIX hardware. For those interested in
using the `Open Ephys GUI <https://open-ephys.org/gui>`__ for acquisition, have
a look at the :ref:`open_ephys_gui` page.

.. note:: The :ref:`API <api_ref>` is meant to be
    used! If you want to incorporate ONIX hardware functionality into your
    acquisition software, please :ref:`get in touch <support>`. It's not as
    hard as you might think :).
