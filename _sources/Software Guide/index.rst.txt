ONIX uses `Bonsai <https://bonsai-rx.org/>`__ for data acquisition. Bonsai is
extremely good at dealing with the asynchronous and heterogeneous data that
ONIX hardware produces.

    - The :ref:`bonsai_onixref` provides detailed information about the Bonsai
      library. 
    - See :ref:`bonsai_examples` for example Bonsai workflows. 
    - The :ref:`open_ephys_gui` page provides information on using the `Open
      Ephys GUI <https://open-ephys.org/gui>`__ with ONIX hardware.

.. note:: If you want to incorporate ONIX hardware functionality into your
    acquisition software, please :ref:`get in touch <support>`. It's not as
    hard as you might think :).
