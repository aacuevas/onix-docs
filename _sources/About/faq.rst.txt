    1. What is Open Ephys?
        Open Ephys is a collection of neuroscientists, engineers, and
        hackers who believe that neuroscience benefits greatly from
        advanced, well-documented, open-source hardware and software.
        Have a look at the `Open Ephys Website <https://open-ephys.org/about-us-overview>`_
        for a comprehensive overview of our mission and projects.

    2. Is ONIX hardware available for purchase?
        The system is currently in a beta test phase and will be made available on
        the `Open Ephys Store <https://open-ephys.org/store>`_ following that.

    3. Where do I get help when using the system?
        Have a look at the :ref:`support` page.

    4. Can I use headstage-64 with a silicon probe instead of tetrodes?
        Yes. Have a look at :ref:`adapters_eibs` to see if an option
        exists for your probe. If not, get in touch (:ref:`support`)
        because making an adapter is quite simple.

    5. Can I use my older, SPI-based Intan headstages with the system?
        No. ONIX headstages use a powerful serialization hardware to
        allow arbitrary mixtures of devices to exist on the headstage.
        This is fundamentally incompatible with older, SPI-based
        headstages. Have a look at :ref:`serialization` for more
        information on why.
 
    6. Why is there no Open Ephys GUI plugin for ONIX hardware?
        Have a look at the :ref:`open_ephys_gui` page.

    7. I have existing acqusition hardware. Can I can use your API and software
       to acquire data from it?
        Our API design explicity decouples hardware details from API
        functionality. Have a look at the :ref:`drivers` page for more
        information on integrating your hardware into the ONIX software stack.
        Depending on how your device communicates with the computer, you may be
        10's of lines of C away from having this "just work".
