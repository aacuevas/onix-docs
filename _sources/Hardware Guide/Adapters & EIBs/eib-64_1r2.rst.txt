#########################
**eib-64 v1.2** is a 64-channel electrode interface board (EIB) with electrical
and optical stimulation. It is designed for small animal (e.g. mouse) tetrode
electrophysiology and is compatible with :ref:`headstage_64_1r3` and is
designed to be used with the mouse variant of the `shuttle-drive
<https://open-ephys.org/shuttledrive>`_.
