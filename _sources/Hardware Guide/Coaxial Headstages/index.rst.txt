Coaxial Headstages
==========================================
Here you will find information on ONIX coaxial headstages.

We hope that there will be community additions to this list. Implementing your
own coax headstage that incorporates other sensors (e.g cameras, temperature,
etc), or even custom ASICs (e.g. next gen ephys probes) and have automatic
integration with existing ONIX headstages and hardware can be quite simple.

.. note:: If you're interested in creating a custom headstage that "just works"
    with existing ONIX hardware and software, please get in touch using the links
    on the :ref:`support` page.
